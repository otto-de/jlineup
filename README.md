# JLineup

#### About
JLineup is a command line tool which is useful for visual acceptance tests in continuous
delivery pipelines. It can make and compare screenshots from before and after a deployment
of a web page. Through comparison of the screenshots it detects every changed pixel.
JLineup generates a HTML report and a JSON report.
Behind the scenes, it uses Selenium and a browser of choice (currently Chrome, Firefox and
PhantomJS are supported).

JLineup is a configuration compatible replacement
for Lineup, implemented in Java. The original
[Lineup](https://github.com/otto-de/lineup) is
a Ruby tool. We did a rewrite in Java, because we can
leverage some quicker image comparison here and we can
get rid of Ruby in our JVM-based pipelines.

#### Howto

JLineup comes as executable Java Archive.
You need a working Java 8 Runtime Environment on your system.
Open a terminal, navigate to the place where your jlineup.jar lives and type

    java -jar jlineup.jar --help
  
to get some idea how to use it.
